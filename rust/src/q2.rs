 * You are given a heap of N tokens, which you may divide into any number of smaller heaps. You will then receive an
 * amount of money equal to the product of the number of tokens in each heap. The rules of this game state that if you
 * were to just leave all the tokens in one heap, you would win Â£N.
 *
 * What is the largest sum of money you can win starting with six tokens?
 * What about starting with 10 tokens?
 * Is there a general best strategy for N tokens?
